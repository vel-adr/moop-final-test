# moop-final-test

This is a project for the Mobile Object-Oriented Programming Course final test. I am asked to build an Android application which requirements are as follows:
  - Application is starting from an activity. The activity consists of 2 spinners and a button.
  - When the user clicks the button, it should start a new activity which has an EditText for name, 4 Checkboxes for conditions, and a button. The conditions showed is depend on the user's choices from the last activity. When the button is clicked, the program will get all the data from EditText and Checkboxes and save it locally.
  - Built using Java.
